# coding-quiz Readme! 

Welcome to my coding quiz! This webpage was created as part of a project through the UW Coding Bootcamp course that I am taking. 

This website contains a multiple choice quiz on the topic CODING! It can be used to help people study the subject! 


HOW TO USE THE WEBSITE:

To use this site there is NO installation necessary, 

Just simply click the START button on the page to begin the quiz. 

You will be prompted with a question and then multiple choice answers beneath. 

Click on your choice of answer to be able to move on to the next question. 

When you reach the end of the quiz, you will see a "done" button. Click that to complete the quiz and your score will show up in an alert prompt. 

You will then be prompted to optionally enter your initials to save your high score for future reference. 

Simply type your initials in the form that appears below the quiz, and then click 'submit' next to the text entry box
Please note that this will only save your score to your devices LOCALLY. Meaning that if you clear your devices local storage cache, or use a different device, you will not be able to see your saved high score.
